# Earthquakes_Central_America
Analysis of NEIC dataset recording worldwide earthquakes from 1965-2016

What I learned during this project:
- Create tools (def functions) to make my code shorter and more efficient.
- How to use follium to graph points on a geospace location, and creating heatmaps.
- Improve visualization skills with matplotlib and seaborn to make graphs look better
